LENS + SOURCE
-------------

For a simple lens-source system, the ray tracing is as follows:

            / \
           /   \
          /     \
         /       \
        /         \
       /           \
Earth  --- Lens1 --- Source
       \           /
        \         /
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
            \ /

So, to perform ray-tracing, we:

1) Compute deflection angles at Lens1 (the image_plane_image-plane).
2) Trace image_plane_image-plane coordinates to source-plane.

LENS + LENS + SOURCE
--------------------

For a lens-lens-source system, the ray tracing is as follows:

                / \
               /   \
            --      \
           /         \
          /           \
         /             \
Earth-Lens1-Lens2----- Source
         \             /
          \           /
           \         /
            --      /
               \   /
                \ /

So, to perform ray-tracing, we:

1) Compute deflection angles at Lens1 (the image_plane_image-plane)
2) Trace to Lens2's lens-plane, by using the deflection angles scaled by the ratio of angular diameter distances, Beta.
3) Compute deflection angles at Lens2, using Lens2's lens-plane coordinates.
4) Trace to Source's plane, using each set of deflection angles scaled by new values of Beta to reflect the new redshifts
of the tracing.

MULTIPLE PLANES
---------------

Following LENS+LENS+SOURCE above, we go to each lens, compute its deflection angles at its lens-plane coordinates
and then use them with the scale factor beta to trace them to the next source-plane. We compute the deflection angles at
each set of source-plane coordinates and scale by redshift as appropriate.


Beta_ij = D_ij * D_s / D_j * D_is

Therefore, when we compute Beta for a plane i and another plane j, we need four things:

D_ij - the angular diameter distance between planes i and j.
D_s - the angular diameter distance from earth to the highest redshift plane.
D_j - The angular diameter distance from earth to plane j
D_is - The angular diameter distance from plane i to the highest redshift plane.

For a 3 plane system, we have the following beta terms:

Beta_12
Beta_13
Beta_23

Note that the Beta_13 and Beta_23 terms cancel out to give an answer Beta = 1.0

For a 4 plane system, wwe have the following beta term:

Beta_12
Beta_13
Beta_23
Beta_14
Beta_24
Beta_34

Note that Beta_14, Beta_24 and Beta_34 all cancdel to give Beta = 1.0

Thus, we need the angular diameter distances between all planes.
