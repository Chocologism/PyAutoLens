Chapter 1: Strong Lensing
=========================

In chapter 1, we'll introduce you to strong gravitational lensing and the core PyAutoLens API.

The chapter contains the following 9 tutorials:

`Tutorial 0 Visualization: <https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/chapter*1*introduction/tutorial*1*visualization.html>`_
Set up and customize Matplotlib visualization in Jupyter notebooks to ensure they display correctly.

Grids -
Creating 2D uniform *Grid*'s of coordinates which are used for ray-tracing.

Profiles -
Using *LightProfile*'s and *MassProfile*'s to analytically describe a galaxy's light and mass.

Galaxies -
Creating *Galaxy*'s by collecting light and mass profiles at a given redshift.

Planes -
Creating *Planes* by collecting *Galaxy*'s at similar redshifts.

Ray Tracing -
How to use many galaxies to create a *Tracer*, and combine this with a *Grid* to perform strong lens ray-tracing.

More Ray Tracing -
Advanced lensing calculations with the *Tracer*

Data -
Loading *Imaging* data of a strong lens representative of Hubble Space Telescope imaging.

Fitting -
Fitting *Imaging* data with the strong lens image predicted by a *Tracer*.

Summary -
A Summary of the chapter.
