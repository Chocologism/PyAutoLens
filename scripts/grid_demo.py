# We will also be able to attach a pixelization to a galaxy, which is used to reconstruct the image via a pixel
# grid_coords. source_galaxy = galaxy.Galaxy(pixelization=AdaptivePixelization)

# Given that the galaxy's (and therefore pixelizations) are attached to a plane, for each plane we can retrieve its
# mapping matrix. The mapping matrix is what is called f in Warren & Dye 2003 and tells us the mapping between every
# image and source pixel):
# e.g. ray_trace.source_plane.compute_mapping_matrix()

# Thus, from a ray_tracing instance, we can extract all the model images / pixelization mapping matrices we could ever
# desire. These will then be used to fit in the image weighted_data in what will be the 'analysis' module.


### POTENTIAL GRID ###

# The potential grid_coords is basically a rectangular grid_coords of coordinates (e.g. of size (20, 20)). We could
# store these coordinates as another attribute of the GridCoordsCollection class, such that when we call
# TraceImageAndSource, the image_plane has an additional set of coordinates ray_trace.image.plane.grids.potential_grid.
# In the image plane, the galaxy potential at these coordinates will be automatically computed.

# The potential grid_coords is computed in the image-plane, so it doesn't need to know the traced image coordinates in
# the source-plane. Thus, we'll make sure the potential grid_coords coordinates do not have their deflection angles
# computed and that they are not traced to the source plane.

# Now our image plane knows the potential grid_coords coordinates (and the galaxies in image plane, from which to
# compute their potentials), We could extract the potential grid_coords much like the model images / pixelization above:
# e.g. ray_trace.compute_potential_grid()

# My guess is that this will do something along the lines of:

# 1) Using the image plane, compute the potential on the potential_grid.
# 2) Using the source plane, determine the mapping matrix or whatever quantity to needed for the potential grid_coords.
# 3) Use the above quantities to set up the potential grid_coords mapping matrix, which is then passed to the
# analyis_image module for fitting the weighted_data.
