# In this example, we'll simulate a basic lens + source galaxy system and output the images (as .fits) for modeling
# with AutoLens (see the phase/basic.py example).

# We need to set up the grids of Cartesian coordinates we will use to perform ray-tracing. The function below
# sets these grids up using the shape and pixel-scale of the image we will ultimately simulate. The PSF shape is
# required to ensure that edge-effects do not impact PSF blurring later in the simulation.

# Use the 'galaxy' module (imported as 'g'), 'light_profiles' module (imported as 'lp') and 'mass profiles' module
# (imported as 'mp') to setup the lens galaxy. The lens below has an elliptical Sersic light profile and singular
# isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile.

# Pass these galaxies into the 'ray_tracing' module, in this particular case a tracer which has both an image and source
# plane. Using the lens galaxy's mass profile(s), deflection-angle and ray-tracing calculations are performed to
# setup the source-plane.

# we want to extract the image-plane image of our lens and source galaxies - lets have a look at what it looks like.

### NOTE - currently we have to explictly map this image from a 1D array, which is used to perform autolens analysis.
### In the near future this 2D mapping will be perform implicitly within the tracer class and the confusing syntax below
### will be hidden from the user - e.g. (tracer.image_plane_image) will be all you need!

# Next, we simulate the image, using the simulate function in the imaging module. We add various effects, including
