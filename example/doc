The inversion module is used to reconstruct the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the strongly lensed source
galaxy(s) in an observed image on a pixelized-grid. It is composed of the following 5 modules:

1) mappers_of_planes - The different mappers_of_planes (e.g. rectangular, Voronoi) which can be used to reconstruct sources.

2) pixelization_mappers - Describes the mappings between a mapper's pixels and observed image's pixels.

3) regularization - The regularization schemes that are used to apply smoothing to the reconstructed source.

5) inversion - Performs the inversion, reconstructing the source in a linear fashion which best fits the observed image.
