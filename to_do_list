Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

1) Finish fitting refactor, including tutorials.
2) Reduce memory use
3) Multiplane for Nan
4) Write MultiNest constant efficiency mode howtolens
5) Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
5a) Read and update all howtolens tutorials
6) Power-law Analytic Deflections
7) Magnification + sCaustic + Critical curves
8) Image loading sanity checks
9) Interpolation Scheme for fast deflection angles
10) Implement faster numerical integration (Ashley Kelly)
11) SLACS Database
12) Docstrings
13) Parallelize MultiNest

Dec/Jan) Automated Prior Linking
Dec/Jan) Pixelization which Adapts to source's light (not magnification).
Dec/Jan) Hyper-image analysis in fitting modules.
Dec/Jan) Hyper Analysis intergration at high level (e.g. phase).
Dec/Jan) Write hyper analysis howtolens

Jan/Feb) Multi-plane analysis.

2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2019) Multi-Image analysis.
