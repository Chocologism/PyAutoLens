Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

Big Picture:

- RJLens pipelines.
- CTI Results section.

Small Picture:

- Refactor Phase
- Template API
- Grid Stack PReload
- MultiNest settings of hyper phases.
- Include Background in Hyper phases.
- Unit Test HyperNoise Maps
- Implement Amy's branch.
- Summarize output
- Fix model.info file
- Fit Summary with likelhood, evidence, RFF, etc.

- 2d Grid mappings and arrays - build into profiles / galaxy modules
- Ray tracing refactor.

- point source ray tracing, modeling, etc.
- classmethods using realistic lens units.
- Lensing example test data suites.
- Aggregator use examples.
- Units for images, grids.
- Multinest MPI.
- Memory lite.
- Make mass calculations faster.
- model.summary info output.
- Sort out radial minima tests.
- Extract square around mask, so no rectnagular pixels.
- clean up plotting_centres of profiles in plotters (dodgy if loop in plotter, color by galaxy).
- Expanded visualization tests.
- positions still plotting wrong?
- Expand intepolation tests and write tutorial.
- Challenge mass errors.

- Optimization

Rich:

- Setup with unit test to get ideal output logging info.
- New hyper phase stuff.
- High level units stuff?

Amy:

- Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves

Short term:

- Add feature to remove astropy bug.

Mid term:

- Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, ccd settings, etc).
- Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
- CCD loading sanity checks

Long Term:

- Automated Prior Linking
- Write hyper analysis howtolens
- Multi-plane analysis.

Future:

2019) Population module for simulating large suites of 'realistic' lenses.
2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2020) Multi-CCD analysis.


Possible:

- position updating / thresholding.

Bugs:

- Rectangular plots of source recons are still skewing.
- Different colorbar scales for parametric source and pixelization source.


Notes:

Useful stats for a fit:

Residual Flux total
Residual Flux Fraction
Reduced Chi Squared
Summed regularization
Stuff combining chi squared with regularization
