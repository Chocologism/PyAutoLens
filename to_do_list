Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

9 Day Crash Course:

- Fix truncated nfw
- Subhalo grid search on cosma
- Units for critical surface mass density + mass calculations
- Turn mass profile iniputs to redshift + cosmology
- Integration tests + pipelines for redshift feature.
- classmethods using realistic lens units.
- Lensing example test data suites.
- Aggregator use examples.
- Integration tests + pipelines for noise scaling.
- RJLens pipeline.
- Units for images, grids.
- Implment weighted kmeans (day before Rich if psosible)
- Multinest MPI.
- Memory lite.

- CTI model runs, generate results for papers.
- CTI images, reqirements, via aggregator.

Rich:

- Fix grid search bug.
- Parallelize grid search.
- Setup with unit test to get ideal output logging info.
- New hyper phase stuff.
- High level units stuff?

Big Picture:

- RJLens pipelines.
- Requirements errors.
- CTI Results images / requirement code.
- CTI Results section.

Small Picture:

- model.summary info output.
- Sort out radial minima tests.
- Extract square around mask, so no rectnagular pixels.
- clean up plotting_centres of profiles in plotters (dodgy if loop in plotter, color by galaxy).
- Expanded visualization tests.
- positions still plotting wrong?
- Expand intepolation tests and write tutorial.
- Challenge mass errors.

Amy:

- Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves

Short term:

- Add feature to remove astropy bug.

Mid term:

- Ray tracing refactor.
- Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, ccd settings, etc).
- Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
- CCD loading sanity checks
- Elegent handling of model image generation in lens_fit module, by building model image generation into
  lens_fit_util, in an analogous fashion to unmasked image generation. The key point here is we can make it so
  the fit module does not 'know' whether it is a lens + source plane system, or a multi-plane system. It should
  just generate lists of model images across all planes and for all galaxies.

Long Term:

- Automated Prior Linking
- Hyper Analysis intergration at high level (e.g. phase).
- Write hyper analysis howtolens
- Multi-plane analysis.

Future:

2019) Population module for simulating large suites of 'realistic' lenses.
2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2019) Multi-CCD analysis.


Possible:

- position updating / thresholding.

Bugs:

- Rectangular plots of source recons are still skewing.


Notes:

Useful stats for a fit:

Residual Flux total
Residual Flux Fraction
Reduced Chi Squared
Summed regularization
Stuff combining chi squared with regularization
