Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

Ran Dates

Big Picture:

- RJLens pipelines.
- Requirements errors.
- CTI Results images / requirement code.
- CTI Results section.

Small Picture:

- challenge halo info output.
- Challenge mass errors.
- redshifts into pipeline.
- clean up plotting_centres of profiles in plotters (dodgy if loop in plotter, color by galaxy).
- hyper galaxy phase stuff.
- Expand intepolation tests and write tutorial.

Short term:

- Inclusion of lens / source redshifts for analysis.
- Ray tracing refactor.
- Add feature to remove astropy bug.
- classmethods to generate profiles from physical values (e.g. magnitudes, velocity dispersion, stellar mass, halo mass)

Mid term:

- Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, ccd settings, etc).
- Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
- Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves
- CCD loading sanity checks
- SLACS Database (Cristoph)
- Parallelize MultiNest
- Elegent handling of model image generation in lens_fit module, by building model image generation into
  lens_fit_util, in an analogous fashion to unmasked image generation. The key point here is we can make it so
  the fit module does not 'know' whether it is a lens + source plane system, or a multi-plane system. It should
  just generate lists of model images across all planes and for all galaxies.

Long Term:

- Automated Prior Linking
- Pixelization which Adapts to source's light (not magnification).
- Hyper Analysis intergration at high level (e.g. phase).
- Write hyper analysis howtolens
- Multi-plane analysis.

Future:

2019) Population module for simulating large suites of 'realistic' lenses.
2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2019) Multi-CCD analysis.


Possible:

- position updating / thresholding.

Bugs:

- Rectangular plots of source recons are still skewing.


Notes:

Useful stats for a fit:

Residual Flux total
Residual Flux Fraction
Reduced Chi Squared
Summed regularization
Stuff combining chi squared with regularization
