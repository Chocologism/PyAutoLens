Features:

    - Stochastic mode
    - PyLops.
    - Sanity checks on priors, e.g. intensity and effective radius, size of PSF up to 21x21.
    - Self calibration.
    - GradientSolver + Caustic grid refinement.
    - Position solver + modeling.
    - Summarize model.
    - Simulated lensed image from discrete image grid.
    - classmethods using realistic lens units.

Readthedocs:

    - Data description in General section.
    - Advanced: - Pipelines, Aggregator, hyper mode, SLaM.
    - nbsphinx for notebooks + make API docs work.
    - Guide to model customization API.
    - Mask / PSF issue when loading data (auto pad image).

Workspace:

    - AutoGalaxy Workspace.
    - Background sky in image examples, better descriptioon of noise-map.
    - Better desciption of what a good or bad noise-map and signal to noise-map looks like.
    - Gaussian pipeline API.

Optimization:

    - Hack kmeans for speed via removing nearest neighbor.

Refactor:

    - Move some of MaskedDataset options to a FitOptions class.
    - Unit tests for FitGalaxy Visualizer + Galaxy fitting in general.
    - Homogenize all units of autolens internally, removing types and documenting units with al.convert.

Bugs:

    - Check if grid from relocated grid ruins Grid API an types for multiplane.

Future:

    - Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, imaging settings, etc).
    - Population module for simulating large suites of 'realistic' lenses.
    - Positional / Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement).
    - Multi-Imaging analysis.
