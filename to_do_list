Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

1) Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
2) Power-law Analytic Deflections
3) Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves
4) CCD loading sanity checks
5) Interpolation Scheme for fast deflection angles
6) SLACS Database (Cristoph)
7) Parallelize MultiNest
8) Elegent handling of model image generation in lens_fit module, by building model image generation into
   lens_fit_util, in an analogous fashion to unmasked image generation.

Jan) Automated Prior Linking
Jan) Pixelization which Adapts to source's light (not magnification).
Jan) Hyper Analysis intergration at high level (e.g. phase).
Jan) Write hyper analysis howtolens

Feb/Mar) Multi-plane analysis.

2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2019) Multi-CCD analysis.
