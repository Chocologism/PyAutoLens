Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

- Lensing Results.
- J1070.
- Email Patrick about CIL.
- Ellish + Sort of JeS Grant. -> Waiting for email.
- Groningen. -< Need grant code.
- China flights.

Big Picture:

- RJLens pipelines.

SLACS:

- Swap results of slacs1250 from hyper_galaxies to hyper_galaxies_bg_noise

UV Plane:

- Extend lens_data to have LensCCDData, LensInterferometerData.
- PhaseCCDData, PhaseInterometer - PhaseImaging is now abstract Phase.

Small Picture:

- Acceptance ratio override on MultiNest run. This may require a new error estimator :(
- Simulated lensed image from discrete image grid.
- Iterator grids.
- Unmasked bool decorator.
- PSF in light profiles, etc.
- Plot plane image as square, not rectangle
- Use model image for norm range on subplots.
- Unit Test HyperNoise Maps
- Summarize output
- Fit Summary with likelhood, evidence, RFF, etc.
- point source ray tracing, modeling, etc.
- classmethods using realistic lens units.
- Lensing example test data suites.
- Units for images, grids.
- Multinest MPI.
- Memory lite.
- Make mass calculations faster.
- Sort out radial minima tests.
- clean up plotting_centres of profiles in plotters (dodgy if loop in plotter, color by galaxy).
- Expanded visualization tests.
- Expand intepolation tests and write tutorial.
- Challenge mass errors.

Amy:

- Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves

Short term:

- Add feature to remove astropy bug.

Mid term:

- Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, ccd settings, etc).
- CCD loading sanity checks

Future:

2019) Population module for simulating large suites of 'realistic' lenses.
2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2020) Multi-CCD analysis.


Possible:

- position updating / thresholding.


Notes:

Useful stats for a fit:

Residual Flux total
Residual Flux Fraction
Reduced Chi Squared
Summed regularization
Stuff combining chi squared with regularization
