Hey, welcome to my PyAutoLens to-do. This should give you a sense of what we're working on.

Let me know if you think anything is missing, or should be pushed up the to-do list ;)

Paper tasks:

- Summary of grant proposal data / analysis vision.
- RJLens pipelines.
- CTI prep and scripts.
- CTI Results section.

Task list:

- hot fix on amy.
- Check negative kappa for mass-sheet.
- challenge halo info output.
- plot_centres_of_galaxies / profiles in plotters.
- hyper galaxy phase stuff.
- redshifts into pipeline.
- Expanded visualization libbrary and fix rectangular plot bug.
- Expand intepolation tests and write tutorial.

Short term:

- Quantitive output of lens model results (e.g. einstein mass, magnification), include otf output
- Inclusion of lens / source redshifts for analysis.
- Bug with NFW potentials for MultiNest.
- Ray tracing refactor.
- Add feature to remove astropy bug.

Mid term:

- Include output of data for a simulation (galaxies, ccd settings, etc).
- Write Adaptive Grid howtolens.
- Magnification + Caustic + Critical curves
- CCD loading sanity checks
- SLACS Database (Cristoph)
- Parallelize MultiNest
- Elegent handling of model image generation in lens_fit module, by building model image generation into
  lens_fit_util, in an analogous fashion to unmasked image generation. The key point here is we can make it so
  the fit module does not 'know' whether it is a lens + source plane system, or a multi-plane system. It should
  just generate lists of model images across all planes and for all galaxies.

Long Term:

Feb/Mar) Automated Prior Linking
Feb/Mar) Pixelization which Adapts to source's light (not magnification).
April) Hyper Analysis intergration at high level (e.g. phase).
April) Write hyper analysis howtolens

May) Multi-plane analysis.

2019) Quasar modeling (time-delays, variable cosmology, PSF refinement)
2019) UV-plane
2019) Multi-CCD analysis.


Possible:

- position updating / thresholding.

Bugs:

- Rectangular plots of source recons are still skewing.
