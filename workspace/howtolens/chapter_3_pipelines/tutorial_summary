Congratulations, you can now write and use pipelines in PyAutoLens!

At this point, I would like you to take a look at the 'workspace/pipelines/examples' folder. Here, you'll find lots of
template pipelines that perform a range of different lens model fits. In general, I would recommend that you check to
see if a template exists for what you want to do with PyAutoLens, before attempting to write a pipeline from scratch.

If a pipeline isn't available for your scientific needs, and you go on to write your own, feel free to get in contact
with me to add it to the examples. We really have no idea what science people are ultimately going to do with
PyAutoLens, so we really have no idea of the weird and wonderful pipelines people will craft along the way!

Before moving onto chapter 4, there's one more thing I'd like you to do. At this point, you're probably a bit bored of
fitting simulated images. Sure, they're informative, and look pretty, but I think its time you model a real strong lens,
Don't you?

In the example pipelines folder, you'll find a pipeline called 'slacs_1430+4105'. This pipeline models a real strong
lens (whose data was included with PyAutoLens). Infact, the pipeline will go on to fit the lens with a pixelized
source-reconstruction, which is the topic of chapter 4, so you'll also get a sneak peak of our next topic!
