    "# The process of computing a likelihood in AutoLens can be visualized in exactly the same way. We have a set of lens \n",

    "# similar likelihood value. The 2D PDF between the source galaxy's light-profile's intensity (I_l4) and effective \n",
    "# radius (R_l4) shows a degeneracy. This makes sense - making the source galaxy brighter and smaller is similar to\n",
    "# making it fainter and bigger!\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, how does PyAutoLens know where to look in parameter space? A parameter, say, the Einstein Radius, could in \n",

    "# parameter space with 'reasonable' values (i.e. Einstein radii of around 1\"-3\").\n",

    "\n",

    "#                    and a width sigma. For example, an Einstein radius might assume a mean value of 1.0\" and width\n",
