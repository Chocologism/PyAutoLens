You are now familiar with PyAutoLens and have a beginner's understanding of lens modeling. In this chapter, we'll
introduce pipelines, a concept we not so subtly hinted at towards the end of the last chapter. Pipelines allow us to
generically link phases together, so that we can seamlessly navigate the complex non-linear parameter spaces that come
when fitting realistic lens models.

The interface for writing pipelines doesn't mesh nicely with Juypter notebooks. Pipelines are a fairly long block of
code, which runs all at once. Breaking it down into notebook cells obfuscates this interface, and running
each cell by itself does nothing.

Therefore, I recommend you do these tutorials using python scripts. Whereas these scripts were in a sub-directory
previously, I've relegated the Jupyter notebooks to that directory for this chapter. If you want, you can completely
ignore my advise and use notebacks them - I won't take it personally - but you've been warned!

In general, when using PyAutoLens, my advise is to write pipelines as scripts, and run them as Juypter notebooks.
Your code will be a lot cleaner and you'll make fewer mistakes. Once we've written a few pipelines, I'll give an
example of how I recommend that you setup your workspace.
