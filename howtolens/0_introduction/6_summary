In these tutorials, you learnt to do the following with AutoLens:

1) How to perform ray-tracing.
2) How to simulate strong lens imaging.
3) How to fit strong lens imaging.
4) However to find the best-fit lens model of a strong lens, using a non-linear optimization.

Now you're accquited with the basics of AutoLens, I recommend that you begin practising lens models. There are 3 more
example lenses to be modeled, which can be found in this directory:

'elliptical_mass' - In this example, I'll setup the phase for you and introduce a few extra features one can use
                    to customize the phase' behaviour.

'lens_light' - In this example, the lens galaxy's light is also simulated, and thus also needs to be modeled. We'll
               look at how this impacts the run time of AutoLens. You'll also need to write the phase to perform this
               analysis yourself!

'complex_source' - In this example, the source galaxy is generated using a very complex light-profile. We'll see if the
                   simple models we try to fit it with can produce a model image that doesn't leave residuals.

After you are finished with these examples, I would recommend you try modelng one of the real strong lenses that came
packaged with AutoLens (see the 'AutoLens/data folder)'

Finally, once you're feeling confident in using AutoLens, and are familiar with strong lens modelng, you may want to
take one of the advanced AutoLens tutorials (I recommend you stick to the numerical order below):

1_pipeline - In this tutorial, we'll learn how to link multiple phases together to form a pipeline. These phases will
             gradually increase the lens model complexity.

2_inversion - Here, we'll learn about AutoLens's inversion module. This allows us to reconstruct source's on a pixel-
              grid, instead of relying on the light-profiles we've used up to now.
