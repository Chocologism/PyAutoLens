Welcome to HowToLens - The PyAutoLens tutorial!

In this first set of tutorials, we'll learn how to perform basic strong lens modeling in PyAutoLens.

At the end of these 5 tutorials, you'll be able to:

1) Perform ray-tracing and generate images of different image-plane / source-plane strong lensing configurations.
2) Simulate telescope imaging data of a strong gravitational lens.
3) Fit strong lensing data with model images generated via ray-tracing.
4) Find the model which provides the best-fit to strong gravitational lens imaging.
