In these tutorials, you learnt the core of using PyAutoLens. In particular, you've learnt:

1) How AutoLens uses Cartesian grids of (x,y) coordinates to perform ray-tracing.
2) That these grids can be combined with light and mass profiles to compute images and deflection angles.
3) That profiles can be combined to model galaxies.
4) How inputting galaxies into a tracer allows one to perform ray-tracing.
5) How to simulate a telescope's image of a strong lens.
6) How to fit a telescope's image of a strong lens.

What you haven't learnt, however, is how to 'model' a real strong gravitatioanl lens. In the real world, we've no idea
what the 'correct' set of light and mass profile parameters are that will give a good fit to a lens. Lens modeling is
the process of finding the lens model which provides the best-fit, and that will be the focus of our next set of
tutorials.
