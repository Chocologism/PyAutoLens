So, we've learnt how to build pipelines that model strong lenses and customize them to our science case.

However, we ran into a pretty huge barrier when trying to fit complex sources. It required an unweildly number
of non-linear parameters, and even when we included them, the results were inaccurate anyway, non-linear parameter space
was just too complex! We attempted to allieviate this by building a pipeline, but alas even this couldn't help us.

In this chapter, we'll learn about inversions, model and reconstruct the source galaxy using a pixel grid. This grid
has makes no assumptions about the source's morphology, breaking a number of simplifying assumptions that were inherent
to our analytic light profiles (e.g. symmetry). Remarkably, pixels grid use just a couple of non-linear parameters,
meaning the 30+ non-linear parameters we required to fit complex-sources are going to be simplified to just 3 or 4!

Sound good? I agree, so lets get on with it.
