        """
        A lens position fitter, which takes a set of positions (e.g. from a plane in the tracer) and computes \
        their maximum separation, such that points which tracer closer to one another have a higher log_likelihood.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : Grid2DIrregular
            The (y,x) arc-second coordinates of positions which the maximum distance and log_likelihood is computed using.
        noise_value
            The noise-value assumed when computing the log likelihood.
