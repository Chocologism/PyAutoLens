    def __init__(self, pixels, regularization_coefficients=(1.0,), source_signal_scale=1.0):
        """
        Abstract base class for a pixelization, which discretizes a set of image (sub-)coordinates into groups of \
        source-pixels thus determining the mappings between image (sub-)coordinates and source-pixels.

        The regularization matrix of the pixeliztion is also computed, which is used to enforces smoothness a on the \
        source-reconstruction.

        A number of 1D and 2D arrays are used to represent mappings betwen image, sub, source and cluster pixels. The \
        nomenclature here follows grid_to_grid, such that it maps the index of a value on one grid to another. For \
        example:

        - source_to_image[2] = 5 tells us that the 3rd source-pixel maps to the 6th image-pixel.
        - sub_to_source[4,2] = 2 tells us that the 3rd sub-pixel in the 5th image-pixel maps to the 3rd source-pixel.

        NOTE: To make it intuitive, this documentation assumes a Pixelization is always applied to a source-plane and \
        therefore represents the mappings between the image and source planes. However, in principle, a Pixelization \
        could be applied to the image-plane.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels : int
            The number of source pixels in the pixelization.
        regularization_coefficients : (float,)
            The regularization coefficients used to smooth the source reconstruction.
        source_signal_scale : float
            A hyper-parameter which scales the signal attributed to each source-pixel, used for weight regularization.

    def create_mapping_matrix(self, source_sub_grid, sub_to_source):
        """
        Create a new mapping matrix, which describes the fractional unit surface brightness counts between each \
        image-pixel and source pixel. The mapping matrix is denoted 'f_ij' in Warren & Dye 2003,
        Nightingale & Dye 2015 and Nightingale, Dye & Massey 2018.

        The matrix has dimensions [image_pixels, source_pixels] and non-zero entries represents an \
        image-pixel to source-pixel mapping. For example, if image-pixel 0 maps to source-pixel 2, element \
        [0,2] of the mapping matrix will = 1.

        The mapping matrix is created using sub-gridding. Here, each observed image-pixel is divided into a finer \
        sub_grid. For example, if the sub-grid is size 4x4, each image-pixel is split into a uniform 4 x 4 \
        sub grid and all 16 sub-pixels are individually traced to the source-plane and paired with a source-pixel.

        The entries in the mapping matrix therefore become fractional surface brightness values, representing the \
        number of sub-pixel to source-pixel mappings. For example if 3 sub-pixels from image-pixel 4 map to \
        source-pixel 2, then element [4,2] of the mapping matrix will = 3.0 * (1/sub_grid_size**2) = 3/16 = 0.1875. \
